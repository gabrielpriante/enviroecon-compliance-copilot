waste in containers on-site, assuming the facility is located in a state without 
a more stringent authorized state program?

**Jurisdictional Scope**: Federal (40 C.F.R. Part 262)
**Temporal Scope**: Regulations effective as of [current date]
**Key Assumption**: Facility qualifies as LQG (generates ≥1,000 kg/month hazardous waste)
```

#### Example (Unacceptable)

```markdown
## Question

What are the waste rules?
```

❌ **Violations**:
- Insufficiently specific (which waste? which rules?)
- No jurisdictional scope
- No regulatory domain identified
- No assumptions stated

---

### Section 3: Brief Answer

**Purpose**: Provide immediate, conservative response to the question presented.

#### Required Elements

**MUST Include**:
- Direct answer to the specific question
- Conservative interpretation (when ambiguity exists)
- Key regulatory citation(s) supporting the answer
- Explicit caveat for professional review
- Statement of limitations or assumptions affecting answer

**MUST NOT Include**:
- Definitive legal conclusions ("you must", "the law requires you to")
- Advice on specific actions without disclaimer
- Answers unsupported by citations
- Speculation or gap-filling

#### Constraints

- **Length**: 100-400 words
- **Citation Requirement**: Minimum one authoritative citation
- **Language**: Informational, not advisory ("the regulation states" not "you must")
- **Conservative Default**: When interpretation is debatable, state the stricter requirement

#### Example (Acceptable)

```markdown
## Brief Answer

According to 40 C.F.R. § 262.34(a)(1), large quantity generators (LQGs) may 
accumulate hazardous waste on-site in containers for up to 90 days without a 
permit, provided specific management requirements are met.

**Conservative Interpretation**: The 90-day accumulation period begins on the 
date the first drop of hazardous waste is placed in the container, not when 
the container is full. This interpretation ensures compliance even under 
stricter regulatory enforcement.

**Critical Limitation**: This answer assumes federal regulations apply and that 
no state-authorized program imposes more stringent requirements. State regulations 
must be separately verified.

**Professional Review Required**: This analysis is informational only. Facility-
specific compliance determinations should be made by qualified environmental 
professionals with knowledge of state and local requirements.
```

#### Example (Unacceptable)

```markdown
## Brief Answer

You must store waste for no more than 90 days. This is a legal requirement 
and failure to comply will result in penalties. We recommend immediate action.
```

❌ **Violations**:
- Uses prohibited "you must" language
- Implies legal advice
- No citation provided
- No limitations disclosed
- No professional review recommendation

## Regulatory Analysis

### 90-Day Accumulation Time Limit

**Regulatory Requirement**: 40 C.F.R. § 262.34(a)(1) states: "A generator may 
accumulate hazardous waste on-site for 90 days or less without a permit..."

**Interpretation - Accumulation Start Date**:

The regulation does not explicitly define when the "accumulation" period begins. 
Two interpretations exist:

1. **Conservative Interpretation** (Applied): Accumulation begins on the date 
   the first quantity of hazardous waste is placed in the container.
   
   **Rationale**: This interpretation ensures compliance even if regulatory 
   authorities take a strict view. EPA guidance suggests "accumulation start 
   date" should be marked when waste is first added (EPA RCRA Online #14526).
   
2. **Alternative Interpretation**: Accumulation begins when the container is full.
   
   **Risk**: Some state agencies and courts have rejected this interpretation. 
   Applying this interpretation could result in compliance violations if challenged.

**Recommendation**: Apply the conservative interpretation. Facility-specific 
guidance should be obtained from the state environmental agency with jurisdiction.

### Container Management Requirements

**Regulatory Requirement**: 40 C.F.R. § 262.34(a)(1)(i) requires containers 
must be "in good condition" and compatible with waste stored.

**Application**:
- **"Good condition"**: No severe rusting, apparent structural defects, or 
  deterioration (40 C.F.R. § 265.171 incorporated by reference)
- **"Compatible"**: Container material must not react with, dissolve in, or 
  be degraded by waste (40 C.F.R. § 265.172)

**Limitation**: Determination of "good condition" and "compatibility" is 
fact-specific and requires professional engineering judgment. This analysis 
cannot provide facility-specific determinations without detailed inspection.

### [Continue for each regulatory element...]
```

#### Example (Unacceptable)

```markdown
## Regulatory Analysis

You need to store waste properly for 90 days. The containers should be in 
good shape. Most companies do this by keeping waste in standard drums and 
tracking the dates. This is generally acceptable under EPA rules.
```

❌ **Violations**:
- Uses prohibited "you" language
- No specific citations
- Generic "EPA rules" reference
- No interpretation of ambiguities
- No conservative interpretation applied
- Speculation about "most companies"
- No analysis of regulatory elements
- No limitations disclosed

---

### Section 6: Assumptions and Limitations

**Purpose**: Explicitly document all interpretive choices, factual assumptions, and analytical boundaries.

#### Required Elements

**MUST Include**:
- Complete enumeration of all assumptions made
- Categorization of assumptions (factual, interpretive, jurisdictional, temporal)
- Rationale for each significant assumption
- Clear statement of analytical limitations
- Identification of information gaps
- Boundaries of analysis (what is NOT covered)

**MUST NOT Include**:
- Silent or undisclosed assumptions
- Minimization of limitations
- Assumptions presented as facts
- Gaps filled with speculation

#### Assumption Categories

**MUST Categorize All Assumptions**:

1. **Factual Assumptions**: Assumed facts about facility, operations, or circumstances
2. **Interpretive Assumptions**: Choices made in interpreting ambiguous regulatory language
3. **Jurisdictional Assumptions**: Assumptions about applicable jurisdiction or regulatory authority
4. **Temporal Assumptions**: Assumptions about effective dates, deadlines, or regulatory currency
5. **Procedural Assumptions**: Assumptions about standard processes or procedures

#### Example (Acceptable)

```markdown
## Assumptions and Limitations

### Factual Assumptions

1. **Facility LQG Status**: This analysis assumes the facility generates ≥1,000 kg 
   of hazardous waste per month, qualifying as a Large Quantity Generator under 
   40 C.F.R. § 262.34(a).
   
   **Impact if Incorrect**: If facility is Small Quantity Generator (100-1,000 kg/month), 
   different accumulation time limits apply (180 or 270 days depending on distance 
   to disposal facility - 40 C.F.R. § 262.34(d)).

2. **Federal Jurisdiction**: This analysis assumes facility is subject to federal 
   RCRA regulations under 40 C.F.R. Part 262.
   
   **Impact if Incorrect**: If facility is in state with EPA-authorized RCRA 
   program, state regulations may be more stringent and would supersede federal 
   requirements.

3. **Container Storage Method**: This analysis assumes hazardous waste is stored 
   in containers (drums, tanks with capacity ≤ specifications).
   
   **Impact if Incorrect**: Different regulations apply to tank systems, containment 
   buildings, or drip pads.

### Interpretive Assumptions

1. **Accumulation Start Date**: As discussed in Section 5, this analysis applies 
   the conservative interpretation that accumulation begins when first waste is 
   added to container.
   
   **Alternative View**: Some sources suggest accumulation begins when container 
   is full. Rejected due to enforcement risk.

2. **"Good Condition" Standard**: Interpreted to mean no visible structural defects, 
   consistent with 40 C.F.R. § 265.171.
   
   **Limitation**: Actual condition assessment requires professional inspection.

### Jurisdictional Assumptions

1. **State Authorization Status**: This analysis does not account for state-specific 
   requirements in EPA-authorized states.
   
   **States with Potentially Stricter Requirements**: California, New York, New Jersey, 
   Massachusetts, and others have authorized programs. State regulations must be 
   separately reviewed.

2. **Local Ordinances**: This analysis does not include local (county, municipal) 
   environmental ordinances that may impose additional requirements.

### Temporal Assumptions

1. **Regulatory Currency**: All cited regulations are current as of [verification date: 
   2024-01-15].
   
   **Limitation**: Regulations subject to change. User must verify currency before 
   reliance.

2. **No Pending Regulatory Changes**: This analysis does not account for proposed 
   rules or pending regulatory amendments.

### Limitations of Analysis

**This Analysis Does NOT Cover**:

1. ✗ State-specific RCRA regulations or authorized program variations
2. ✗ Facility-specific permit conditions or consent orders
3. ✗ Local zoning or environmental ordinances
4. ✗ Waste characterization or hazardous waste determinations
5. ✗ Emergency response or spill management requirements
6. ✗ Worker safety requirements (OSHA, right-to-know)
7. ✗ Transportation requirements (DOT regulations)
8. ✗ Disposal facility acceptance criteria
9. ✗ Insurance or financial assurance requirements
10. ✗ Enforcement history or compliance status of specific facility

**Information Gaps Requiring Additional Research**:

1. Specific state regulations applicable to facility location
2. Facility-specific permit conditions or variances
3. Actual waste characterization data
4. Historical compliance or enforcement actions
5. Site-specific engineering considerations

**Professional Review Required For**:

1. Facility-specific compliance determination
2. Hazardous waste characterization and classification
3. Container compatibility assessment
4. State and local regulatory applicability
5. Permit requirement determination
6. Compliance strategy development
